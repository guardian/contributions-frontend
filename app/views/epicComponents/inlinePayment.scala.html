                    &hellip; we have a small favour to ask. More people are reading the Guardian than ever but advertising
                    revenues across the media are falling fast. And <span class="contributions__highlight">unlike many news organisations,
                    we haven’t put up a paywall &ndash; we want to keep our journalism as open as we can.</span>
                    So you can see why we need to ask for your help.
                    The Guardian’s independent, investigative journalism takes a lot of time,
                    money and hard work to produce. But we do it because we believe our perspective matters &ndash;
                    because it might well be your perspective, too.
                </p>
                <p class="contributions__paragraph contributions__paragraph--epic">
                    If everyone who reads our reporting, who likes it, helps to support it, our future would be much more secure.
